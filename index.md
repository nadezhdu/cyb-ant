  <h1><span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is a cyberpunk anthology</h1>
  <p>we will collect works from anons and shitposters and collate them into an anthology of /cyb/ themed works to entertain and inform. the title of this collection will be <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>, a term from machine learning. gradient descent is the process by which a computer refines its model to the best approximation of truth possible through many small increments. our goal is to be a part of this refining process.</p>
  <p>interested contributors should consider the following guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>fiction and nonfiction encouraged</li>
  	<li>written works should be in the range of 2k-5k words</li>
  	<li>artists are also encouraged to contribute - this will be an ebook and color art is welcome</li>
  	<li>this is a volunteer/collaborative project</li>
  </ul>
  <p>details will be forthcoming regarding submissions, editing and promotion. this site will change and grow to reflect the state of the project. for suggestions/inquiries, contact nadezhdu@protonmail.com or contact me on twitter @HopefulAbandon</p>
