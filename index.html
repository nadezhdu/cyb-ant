    <h1><span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is a fiction anthology</h1>
    <p>we collect works from anons and shitposters and collate them into an anthology to entertain and inform. the title of this collection is <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>, a term from machine learning. gradient descent is the process by which a computer refines its model to the best approximation of truth possible through many small increments. our goal is to be a part of this refining process.</p>
    <p>this collection is meant to be mutable and self-defining - to understand what <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is about, you should read it. in very broad terms: right now this is a collection of science fiction and cyberpunk themed short stories. we are always seeking new content. if you want to contribute, please read the guidelines below the break.</p>

    <h3>second convolution of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></h3>
    <p>the first edition of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> was a tremendous success, far exceeding our expectations for the project. thanks to the efforst of many great anons, and legions of skiddies, we are now poised to create an even bigger collection for the second edition. submissions are open until october 31st, 2021. here's how to join us:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>read <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></li>
      <li>think to yourself: what is missing from this collection?</li>
      <li>think to yourself: what would belong to this collection?</li>
      <li>ask yourself: how could I, by inserting one piece of work, make this anthology better?</li>
      <li>write that missing piece</li>
    </ol>
    <p>we say that <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is self-defining - this is what we mean. this anthology is meant to learn from itself, to take its own content as input and <i>convolute</i> that content into something greater. this is constantly happening in fiction all the time, as old stories are cannibalized, deconstructed and recombined inside new ones, gaps or weaknesses or missing elements from previous generations brought to the fore and explored by their inheritors. we want to make this process explicit, to peer inside the mechanism of narrative growth, and to enjoy the experiment in the meantime.</p>
    <p>email submissions as an attachment to <b>graddesc@protonmail.com</b> before october 31st, 2021. we will contact you by november 31st at the latest regarding whether your submission was accepted or rejected. if we like your work but feel it has flaws, we may ask you to make revisions - this will only ever happen before the final due date of october 31st.</p>

    <h3><span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> in print</h3>
    <p>the print version of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is hosted on blurb, a third part print-on-demand service. the price is set by the cost of materials. including shipping it's usually <$10, at least within the united states. none of the money goes to the creators - this is a labor of love. all stories are hosted on this website, and ebook versions are available on the donwloads page.</p>

    <p>the question "what kind of content is appropriate" is not one we want to answer directly. <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is about unsupervised learning, and the editors' vision for this collection is not necessarily the correct one. artists should look at this collection as it stands at time of submission and decide for themselves what are the interesting themes throughout, what would belong next to these stories, or what has been missed by previous contributors. interested artists should consider the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>can be fiction or nonfiction</li>
      <li>can be independent art or artwork made to accompany a written piece</li>
      <li>written works should be in the range of 2k-5k words, although this is flexible</li>
      <li>no porn, smut, obvious self-inserts or using other people's ip (fanfiction)</li>
      <li>all images should be 300dpi and in .jpg, .gif or .png format</li>
      <li>no plagiarism - should go without saying, we will check</li>
      <li>please include a title for the piece, and a name (does not have to be your real name but can be)</li>
    	<li>this is a volunteer/collaborative project</li>
    </ul>
