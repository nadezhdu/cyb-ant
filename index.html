    <h1><span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is a fiction anthology</h1>
    <p>we collect works from anons and shitposters and collate them into an anthology to entertain and inform. the title of this collection is <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>, a term from machine learning. gradient descent is the process by which a computer refines its model to the best approximation of truth possible through many small increments. our goal is to be a part of this refining process.</p>
    <p>this collection is meant to be mutable and self-defining - to understand what <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is about, you should read it. in very broad terms: right now this is a collection of science fiction and cyberpunk themed short stories. we are always seeking new content. if you want to contribute, please read the guidelines below the break.</p>

    <p>the question "what kind of content is appropriate" is not one we want to answer directly. <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is about unsupervised learning, and the editors' vision for this collection is not necessarily the correct one. artists should look at this collection as it stands at time of submission and decide for themselves what are the interesting themes throughout, what would belong next to these stories, or what has been missed by previous contributors. interested artists should consider the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>can be fiction or nonfiction</li>
      <li>can be independent art or artwork made to accompany a written piece</li>
      <li>written works should be in the range of 2k-5k words, although this is flexible</li>
      <li>no porn, smut, obvious self-inserts or using other people's ip (fanfiction)</li>
      <li>all images should be 300dpi and in .jpg, .gif or .png format</li>
      <li>no plagiarism - should go without saying, we will check</li>
      <li>please include a title for the piece, and a name (does not have to be your real name but can be)</li>
    	<li>this is a volunteer/collaborative project</li>
    </ul>
