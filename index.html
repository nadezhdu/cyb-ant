    <h1><span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is a cyberpunk anthology</h1>
    <p>we will collect works from anons and shitposters and collate them into an anthology of /cyb/ themed works to entertain and inform. the title of this collection will be <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>, a term from machine learning. gradient descent is the process by which a computer refines its model to the best approximation of truth possible through many small increments. our goal is to be a part of this refining process.</p>
    <p>cyberpunk as a genre came into the mainstream with william gibson's <a href="http://www.conceptualfiction.com/neuromancer.html">neuromancer</a>, but stagnated along with punk in general as the 21st century brought neither anarchic collapse nor totalitarian domination, but something in between. the anticapitalist, anti-authoritarian themes that drew people to the genre failed to deliver anything more than an escapist fantasy, and today it is a niche aesthetic, only emerging into the mainstream in the form of <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/">video games</a>. it's time to refine what we mean by "cyberpunk" - it's time to apply the genre to the new century.</p>
    <p>cyberpunk is more than a critique of corporate culture: it is a philosophical effort. networks, transhumanism, memetics, intelligence - these are the themes of cyberpunk that interest us the most. the anti-authoritarian element is still important, but equally important is figuring out what authority exactly rules us. emergent behavior built on bad incentives can be just as oppressive as a private police force serving a multinational conglomerate. the way that transhumanism threatens and expands our definitions of humanity, identity and self-determination, such as in masamune shirow's <a href="https://kodanshacomics.com/series/ghost-in-the-shell/">ghost in the shell</a>, is a struggle not only with social norms, but with ourselves. the aim of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is to explore the philosophical side of cyberpunk, to show that it is more than neon lights and rage against the machine. of course, the neon and rage is still important, so don't be afraid of the genre staples. we are not redefining cyberpunk, just refining it - making an incremental improvement.</p>
