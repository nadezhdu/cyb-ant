    <p class="fiction">On the world wide web, you will come in contact with less than a dozen sites. Google, with its Gmail and YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, the occasional visit to Amazon, maybe some news websites, and that's about it (oh, and porn). Like everyone else's, your internet is a prepackaged, socially engineered <i>spy grid</i>. It feeds on your input and weaponizes the information against you and everyone else. Already, the social engineers have been dividing you from everyone else, confusing the tongue, and making it difficult to communicate effectively. This is the new normal. Stare at it. On Google and its YouTube, comments and videos are filtered such that you only come in contact with certain predetermined material derived by social algorithms - they make it nearly impossible to discover new random channels or points of view, but <i>you can't stop progress</i>. Click on a video and scroll down, you're presented with preselected comments that jive with the sort of opinions you tend to agree with, while making you jump through hoops to look at any of the other discussions taking place. Since Google is so influential, this sort of strategy has already found its way on to every facet of the corporate controlled internet. Click on a video of [REDACTED] and see comments that are critical of their phony bullshit and other comments mocking the controlled counterfeit brainwash content. Yet, when not-you clicks on the <i>same</i> video, they'll be presented with comments that agree with their not-you sociopolitical leanings. We're being self-imprisoned on these tiny internet islands where we can't reach out to one another. Get comfortable and stretch your legs, and take in the LED blue light sun you gaze at every day. It's reflected and bounced around by the molecules in the earth's atmosphere, so that means its <i>organic</i> and good for you. Google controls who and what you interact with and see. Divide and conquer the mind of the population. Its a good strategy to quell dissent. So good you couldn't even describe dissent for a chance to win all the tea in China. When you click on controversial news videos or articles, you unwittingly come in to contact with opinions that tend to support your own, and so leave with the sense that there is a consensus on a particular world event where there is none. This engineering of a false consensus has the effect of pacifying the public, making them content in their beliefs, and in being content, they become lazy and stop questioning the world and discussing reality with those around them. By forcing the ignorant to be separate from the wise, from the stupid, from the trolls, even - this system of division impedes the social development of people at large. You, and almost all people on the planet, are confined within your own little bubble of information, a Matrix reservation. The vast majority of modern people only interact with the wider world around them through the lens of the internet. Everything they know and much of their worldview comes from — is directly influenced through — what they experience online. By allowing a cabal of government-corporate entities with advanced technologies at their disposal, to regulate what an individual interacts with online, they can shape and guide the development of your mind. Most of human history and all our accumulated knowledge is already well established on the Internet, and within our lifetimes <i>all</i> of it will be in the cloud. The entire population hardwired into the Internet. Screengrabs and hard drives like VHS tapes of TV recordings, things that otherwise would only exist in your memory. Soon enough our entire species' recorded collective experience, all of our history and knowledge can and will be manipulated; censored by predatory algorithms that edit the data, keeping the truths from us, preventing us from collecting information from the real. The best supercomputers can sift through the entire internet and gradually edit out certain sensitive or undesirable information, even change audio files, manipulate videos. Because most people's identity has been lassoed to the Internet — such that there is no longer anonymity and free exchange — certain people can effectively be silenced. The internet that you come in contact with might be an entirely different internet than others come in contact with. Social engineers are confining certain people within these restricted informational reservations as social and cultural trends which frame the world around you and them are manufactured. It's an insidious strategy — a passive, long-term play. Just as a virus entering a cell coats itself with the host's own membrane, masquerading as self, to elude detection - this supercomputer consciousness, too, uses our own information and our own architecture to elude our defenses and gain entrance into our collective mindscape.</p>
