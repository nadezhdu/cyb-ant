GRADIENT DESCENT is an iterative process by which a model seeks to reflect reality. GRADIENT DESCENT is also a collection of cyberpunk to refine and reimagine the genre, to act as one of those iterations in our collective search for truth. Bright neon and dark dreams, fast cars and big business, deep space and deep learning - this is not science fiction, this is the world we live in. It's time to write something new. It's time to run another iteration. It's time to talk about cyberpunk like we're living in it, because we are. The cyberpunk future is here.
