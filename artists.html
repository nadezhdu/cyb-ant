    <h1>create art for <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></h1>
    <p>we are looking for visual arts that revel in the intensity of the future-now. cyberpunk as an aesthetic style is bold and psychadelic, playing with the intersection of human and machine. some iconic cyberpunk art comes from <a href="https://www.artstation.com/josan">josan gonzalez</a> and <a href="http://sydmead.com/">syd mead</a>, and for more psychadelic work see <a href="https://www.kellyknowles.art/">kelly knowles</a>, but these are not exhaustive. you are encouraged to experiment, to try new ideas, to do something unusual. if you would like to create an artwork to accompany a specific story in <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>, contact us and we will help you coordinate with an interested author.</p>
