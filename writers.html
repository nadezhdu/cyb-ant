    <h1>write for <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></h1>
    <p>we are looking for fiction pieces that reflect the interplay of technology and humanity, and that explore the implications of developments of the present and the near future, whether socially, philosophically or even theologically. cyberpunk fiction can be anything from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/18/philip-k-dick-ubik-reading-group">ubik</a> to <a href="http://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2019/10/22/god-shaped-hole/">god shaped hole</a>, but these are by no means exhaustive. you are encouraged to experiment, to try new ideas, to do something unusual. of course, if your work is coherent, readable and of a reasonable length, it is more likely to become part of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>. if there are problems with your piece we may ask you to revise or rewrite before rejecting, to make sure we don't throw out a good idea with a rought implementation.</p>
