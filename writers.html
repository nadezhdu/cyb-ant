    <h1>write for <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></h1>
    <p>we are looking for fiction pieces that reflect the interplay of technology and humanity, and that explore the implications of developments of the present and the near future, whether socially, philosophically or even theologically. cyberpunk fiction can be anything from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/18/philip-k-dick-ubik-reading-group">ubik</a> to <a href="http://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2019/10/22/god-shaped-hole/">god shaped hole</a>, from <a href="http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/010636.html">k-punk</a> to <a href="http://www.ccru.net/swarm1/1_melt.htm">ccru</a>, but these are by no means exhaustive. you are encouraged to experiment, to try new ideas, to do something unusual. of course, if your work is coherent, readable and of a reasonable length, it is more likely to become part of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>. our editorial team will review your piece and accept it or reject it based on quality, suitability and creativity.</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>fiction and nonfiction encouraged</li>
    	<li>written works should be in the range of 2k-5k words, although this is flexible</li>

      <li>no plagiarism - should go without saying, we will check</li>
      <li>please include a title for the piece, and a name (does not have to be your real name but can be)</li>
      <li>send your piece as an attachment to <b>graddesc@protonmail.com</b> with the subject line "(Nonfiction/Fiction) Submission" so we know what it is</li>
