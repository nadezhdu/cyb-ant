      <h3>second convolution of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></h3>
      <p>the first edition of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> was a tremendous success, far exceeding our expectations for the project. thanks to the efforst of many great anons, and legions of skiddies, we are now poised to create an even bigger collection for the second edition. submissions are open until october 31st, 2021. here's how to join us:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>read <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></li>
       <li>think to yourself: what is missing from this collection?</li>
       <li>think to yourself: what would belong to this collection?</li>
       <li>ask yourself: how could I, by inserting one piece of work, make this anthology better?</li>
       <li>write that missing piece</li>
     </ol>
     <p>we say that <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is self-defining - this is what we mean. this anthology is meant to learn from itself, to take its own content as input and <i>convolute</i> that content into something greater. this is constantly happening in fiction all the time, as old stories are cannibalized, deconstructed and recombined inside new ones, gaps or weaknesses or missing elements from previous generations brought to the fore and explored by their inheritors. we want to make this process explicit, to peer inside the mechanism of narrative growth, and to enjoy the experiment in the meantime.</p>
     <p>email submissions as an attachment to <b>graddesc@protonmail.com</b> before october 31st, 2021. we will contact you by november 31st at the latest regarding whether your submission was accepted or rejected. if we like your work but feel it has flaws, we may ask you to make revisions - this will only ever happen before the final due date of october 31st.</p>
