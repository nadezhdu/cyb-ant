      <h1>second convolution of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></h1>
      <p>the first edition of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> was a tremendous success, far exceeding our expectations for the project. thanks to the efforst of many great anons, and legions of skiddies, we are now poised to create an even bigger collection for the second edition. submissions are open until october 31st, 2021. here's how to join us:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>read <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span></li>
       <li>think to yourself: what is missing from this collection? what would belong to this collection? how could I, by inserting one piece of work, make this anthology better?</li>
       <li>write that missing piece</li>
     </ol>
     <p>we say that <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> is self-defining - this is what we mean. this anthology is meant to learn from itself, to take its own content as input and <i>convolute</i> that content into something greater. this is constantly happening in fiction all the time, as old stories are cannibalized, deconstructed and recombined inside new ones, gaps or weaknesses or missing elements from previous generations brought to the fore and explored by their inheritors. we want to make this process explicit, to peer inside the mechanism of narrative growth, and to enjoy the experiment in the meantime.</p>
     <p>email submissions as an attachment to <b>graddesc@protonmail.com</b> before october 31st, 2021. we will contact you by november 31st at the latest regarding whether your submission was accepted or rejected. if we like your work but feel it has flaws, we may ask you to make revisions - this will only ever happen before the final due date of october 31st.</p>

    <h3>still not sure what to write?</h3>
    <p>we are looking for fiction pieces that reflect the interplay of technology and humanity, and that explore the implications of developments of the present and the near future, whether socially, philosophically or even theologically. you are encouraged to experiment, to try new ideas, to do something unusual. of course, if your work is coherent, readable and of a reasonable length, it is more likely to become part of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span>.</p>
    <p>interested contributors should consider the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>fiction and nonfiction encouraged</li>
    	<li>written works should be in the range of 2k-5k words, although this is flexible</li>
      <li>no porn, smut, obvious self-inserts or using other people's ip (fanfiction)</li>
      <li>no plagiarism - should go without saying, we will check</li>
      <li>please include a title for the piece, and a name (does not have to be your real name but can be)</li>
      <li>send your piece as an attachment to <b>graddesc@protonmail.com</b> with the subject line "(Nonfiction/Fiction) Submission" so we know what it is</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>what will the second convolution look like?</h3>
    <p>the first edition of <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> will remain available online and as a free ebook, and in print. the second edition will follow the same release format: each story will be uploaded to this website, the entire second collection will be available as an ebook for download, and a print-on-demand version will be forthcoming as well. currently we have no definite plans for an "omnibus" style release of all <span class="grad-desc">Gradient Descent</span> works in a single volume, but if the people demand it we will build it.</p>
